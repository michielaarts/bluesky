# Constrained urban airspace utils

In this directory, the utils for analysing a constrained urban airspace are collected.
Two scenario generators, as well as a log reader and two analytical model classes are included.

Additionally, the plugins 'urban_area' and 'asas/speed_based' are required. 

Note: all files should be run with the path extended to the main bluesky folder.
